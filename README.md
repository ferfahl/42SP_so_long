## Main goal
<br>You must create a basic 2D game in which a dolphin escapes Earth after eating some fish. Instead of a dolphin, fish, and the Earth, you can use any character, any collectible and any place you want.
<br>All pixel arts were made by me.

## Introduction
<br>So long and thanks for all the fish
<br>So sad that it should come to this
<br>We tried to warn you all but oh dear
<br>
<br>You may not share our intellect
<br>Which might explain your disrespect
<br>For all the natural wonders that
<br>grow around you
<br> 
<br>So long, so long and thanks
<br>for all the fish
<br>
<br>The world's about to be destroyed
<br>There's no point getting all annoyed
<br>Lie back and let the planet dissolve(around you)
<br>
<br>Despite those nets of tuna fleets
<br>We thought that most of you were sweet
<br>Especially tiny tots and your
<br>pregnant women
<br>
<br>So long, so long, so long, so long, so long
<br>So long, so long, so long, so long, so long
<br>So long, so long and thanks
<br>for all the fish
<br>
<br>If I had just one last wish
<br>I would like a tasty fish
<br>If we could just change one thing
<br>We would all have learned to sing
<br>Come one and all
<br>Man and Mammal
<br>Side by Side in life's great gene pool
<br>
<br>So long, so long, so long, so long, so long
<br>So long, so long, so long, so long, so long
<br>So long, so long and, !Thanks!
<br>for all the fish!
