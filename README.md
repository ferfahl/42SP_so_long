<p>So long and thanks for all the fish</p>
<p>So sad that it should come to this</p>
<p>We tried to warn you all but oh dear</p>
<br>
<p>You may not share our intellect</p>
<p>Which might explain your disrespect</p>
<p>For all the natural wonders that</p>
<p>grow around you</p>
<br> 
<p>So long, so long and thanks</p>
<p>for all the fish</p>
<br>  
<p>The world's about to be destroyed</p>
<p>There's no point getting all annoyed</p>
<p>Lie back and let the planet dissolve(around you)</p>
<br>  
<p>Despite those nets of tuna fleets</p>
<p>We thought that most of you were sweet</p>
<p>Especially tiny tots and your</p>
<p>pregnant women</p>
<br>  
<p>So long, so long, so long, so long, so long</p>
<p>So long, so long, so long, so long, so long</p>
<p>So long, so long and thanks</p>
<p>for all the fish</p>
<br>
<p>If I had just one last wish</p>
<p>I would like a tasty fish</p>
<p>If we could just change one thing</p>
<p>We would all have learned to sing</p>
<p>Come one and all</p>
<p>Man and Mammal</p>
<p>Side by Side in life's great gene pool</p>
<br>
<p>So long, so long, so long, so long, so long</p>
<p>So long, so long, so long, so long, so long</p>
<p>So long, so long and, !Thanks!</p>
<p>for all the fish!</p>
<br>
